# Groq API Interaction Examples

This repository contains examples demonstrating how to interact with the Groq API using Node.js. Each example is based on a tutorial from a YouTube video that guides you through the process of setting up and making the most of Groq's inference API, the OpenAI SDK, Langchain, Llama Index, and Vercel AI SDK.

## Tutorial Video
